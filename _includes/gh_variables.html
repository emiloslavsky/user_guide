% When rendering websites locally, `site.github.url` doesn't get resolved properly
% unless a GitHub Personal Access Token is set up and available in the
% environment. This leads to warnings and errors when trying to serve the site
% locally. To work around this, we use the `jekyll.environment` variable which is
% set to `development` when rendering the site locally, and set to `production` on
% GitHub where `site.github.url` is defined.

{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}

% First, get the name of the repository
{% assign repo_name = site.github.repository_name %}

% `site.github.public_repositories` contains comprehensive information for all public repositories for the organization. We use `where` to extract the part
% of the metadata that is relevant to the present repository.
{% assign repo_info = site.github.public_repositories | where: "name", repo_name %}

% Now, we can extract the default branch for the repo
{% assign default_branch = repo_info[0].default_branch %}

% Other variables requested by the template
{% assign repo_url = site.github.repository_url %}
{% assign search_domain_url = site.github.url %}
{% assign project_title = site.github.project_title %}
{% assign source_branch = site.github.source.branch %}

{% elsif jekyll.environment == "development" %}

{% assign repo_name = "" %}
{% assign repo_url = "" %}
{% assign default_branch = "" %}
{% assign search_domain_url = "" %}
{% assign project_title = "" %}
{% assign source_branch = "" %}

{% endif %}
